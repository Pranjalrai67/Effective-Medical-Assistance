* Axios: HTTP client for making API requests.
* CSS: Styling language for designing user interfaces.
* React Router: Library for handling navigation in React applications.
* UI Component Library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design): For consistent and accessible design of medical forms, tables, etc.
* HTML: Markup language for structuring web content.

**Back-End Development:**

* Node.js or Python (Flask/Django): Web framework for building server-side applications.
* Axios (or equivalent HTTP client): HTTP client for server-side API requests.
* CORS: Middleware for enabling cross-origin requests.
* LLM Integration: Large Language Model integration for intelligent processing of medical text and diagnosis support.
* Computer Vision Libraries (e.g., OpenCV): For processing and analyzing medical images.
* HL7/FHIR Libraries: For handling healthcare data exchange formats.

**Database Management System:**

* PostgreSQL or MySQL: Relational database systems for structured storage of patient data, medical records, etc.
* MongoDB Atlas: Could be used for specific types of unstructured data.

**AI Models:**

* Specialized AI models (e.g., Logistic Regression, CNNs) trained for specific disease diagnosis.
* General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) for text analysis and diagnostic support.
